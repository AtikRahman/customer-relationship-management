# Customer Relationship Management

It's a full-featured Django project where an admin can create customers, orders, and control all of them.
Customers can see their orders only.

In MVT (Model View Template) architecture, Template inheritance is used for reusability.
Decorators are added to restrict user access. Signal and Form are also added.
Registration and login pages are customized.

Here are some screenshots of this project.
